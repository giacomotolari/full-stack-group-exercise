#  Welcome to the Full Stack Group Exercise!!

## In this exercise you will have the opportunity to:

- learn how to organize a project;
- time management;
- work in groups with people you do not know;
- review git, github, react, and everything you have learned so far about the backend.

## You will receive ***six tasks*** that are "mandatory" and ***one Bonus task*** that you have to perform only if you have time.
 
### What we want most from this exercise is for you to enjoy working in groups, analyzing problems and solving them.

### You have to manage your time in such a way that you do the important things first and at the same time write clean, readable code (it will buy you time).


Here are the 6 tasks that you need to complete:

## Task 1 - git/github

Create a github organization where you have two repositories (backend and frontend repo).

## Task 2 - react/express js

Find the fastest way to inilize both the frontend and backend.

## Task 3 - App-layout and react-routing

Create a layout where you will have a navbar with all pages links. The pages are three: home, all-todos and one-todo (show a specific todo).
You can use whatever page names you want, this was just an example!

## Task 4 - Mongoose-MongoDB

Create a MongoDB database that works remotely with Atlas that every member of the group can use.

## Task 5 - CRUD

Use your imagination to create a full-stack app for creating, reading, deleting and updating data.
Everything must work by running requests from the frontend!

## Task 6

Create backend validations ans sanitization. If you have time also validations in frontend!

## Bonus Task

Use your imagination to add/improve something in your App.
