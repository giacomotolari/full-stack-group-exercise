#  Welcome to the Full Stack Group Exercise!!

## In this exercise you will have the opportunity to:

- training for the final project;
- learn how to organize a project;
- time management;
- work in groups with people you do not know;
- review git, github, react, and everything you have learned so far about the backend.

# You will receive six tasks that are "mandatory" and two Bonus tasks that you have to perform only if you have time.
 
# What we want most from this exercise is for you to enjoy working in groups, analyzing problems and solving them.

# You have to manage your time in such a way that you do the important things first and at the same time write clean, readable code (it will buy you time).


## Task 1 - git/github

Create a github organization where you have two repositories (backend and frontend repo).

## Task 2 - react/express js

Find the fastest way to inilize both the frontend and backend.

## Task 3 - App-layout and react-routing

Create a layout where you will have a navbar with all pages links. The pages are three: home, all-todos and one-todo (show a specific todo).
You can use whatever page names you want, this was just an example!

## Task 4 - Mongoose-MongoDB

Create a MongoDB database that works remotely with Atlas that every member of the group can use.

## Task 5 - CRUD

Use your imagination to create a full-stack app for creating, reading, deleting and updating data.
Everything must work by running requests from the frontend!

## Task 6

Create backend validations ans sanitization. If you have time also validations in frontend!

## Bonus Task - Frontend

Improve the frontend by using e.g. useContext to manage your global states, improve navigation e.g. by creating a notFound page if the user navigates to a path that does not exist.
Try to make the app responsive.

## Bonus Task - Backend

Practice everything you have learned about mongoose, try for example to create relations between collections.

## Tips

1) You have little time so manage your time well with your group, find a solution to split the tasks.

2) When you work in a group and everyone does a different task it is easy to have conflicts with git branches. Avoid conflicts by splitting the code into as many files as possible and then working in different files.

3) Write code carefully, use proper names, and format each file to prevent errors and misunderstandings.

4) Don't stress about style; it is not important for this exercise. Focus on the functionality of the app.
